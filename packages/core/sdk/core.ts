// `Cmd` is the typed-effects surface (spec section 2): `update` (and, since
// v2, `initialModel`) may return `[model, cmd]`, where the cmd is INERT DATA
// describing effects for the runtime to perform after the returned model
// commits. Commands are built only from these factories, and only in that
// return path (NS1017) — they never live in the Model, in a Msg, in a local,
// or in a helper.
//
// The v3 command set:
//
//   Cmd.none                     no effects (what a bare `return model` means)
//   Cmd.persist()                ask the host to persist the committed model
//   Cmd.now("tick")              request a timestamp; the runtime dispatches
//                                the named Msg arm with the time (ms) as its
//                                single number payload field
//   Cmd.host(name, ...args)      a host command by name with scalar args —
//                                the host interprets the name
//   Cmd.host(name, payload)      the same, carrying one bytes payload — a
//                                Uint8Array, or a flat record of number /
//                                boolean / Uint8Array fields that lowers to
//                                bytes (hostRecordBytes below)
//   Cmd.request(name, payload,   a routed host command: the host performs it
//               { key?, ok, err })  and dispatches the `ok` Msg arm with the
//                                result bytes, or the `err` arm with the error
//                                bytes — each arm carries exactly one
//                                Uint8Array payload field, checked by tsc. The
//                                optional `key` names the in-flight effect:
//                                re-issuing a live key replaces it, and
//                                Cmd.cancel(key) drops it.
//   Cmd.cancel(key)              drop the in-flight keyed effect — request,
//                                readFile/writeFile/fetch/clipboardRead, or
//                                delay — SILENTLY (no terminal arm dispatch).
//                                Aimed at a live spawn it stays LOUD: the
//                                child dies and the err arm runs with
//                                "cancelled" — killing a process is an

//                                two-field record — one number field (the real
//                                HTTP status, non-2xx included) and one
//                                Uint8Array field (the whole body) — err arm

//                                as its single number payload; re-issuing a

//                                code); collect mode: a two-field record, one

//                                host resolves the source cascade (local path
//                                first, then a verified cache entry, then the

//                                echoed) — state "loaded" with the decoded
//                                width/height, or one failure class. One load
//                                per id at a time: a duplicate live id
//                                dispatches state "rejected".

//                                — loud, the spawn discipline: the load's
//                                event arm delivers state "cancelled" and the
//                                id frees for a fresh load once it lands. An
//                                id with no live load no-ops.
//   Cmd.imageUnregister(id)      free the registry slot under the id: the
//                                pixels are released, views referencing the
//                                id draw their fallback, and the slot is
//                                open for another load. Synchronous registry
//                                surgery like registration itself — not an
//                                effect, no Msg follows; an id with no
//                                registration no-ops. A load IN FLIGHT under
//                                the id is untouched: its terminal still
//                                registers — cancel the load first to keep
//                                the slot free.
//   Cmd.channelOpen(key, { event })
//                                open an EXTERNAL-SOURCE CHANNEL under the

//                                long-lived, thread-safe posting seam its
//                                NATIVE side feeds — embedders and
//                                platform-services extensions post bytes
//                                from their own threads (sockets, watchers,
//                                workers), and each accepted post arrives as
//                                one "data" event through the `event` arm
//                                (the five-field record below) with the
//                                honest back-pressure counters aboard. The
//                                TS tier opens, closes, and receives;
//                                POSTING is not a TS verb — transpiled cores
//                                are single-threaded by design, so the
//                                posting handle lives on the native side
//                                (`Effects.channelHandle(key)`). One channel
//                                per key at a time: a duplicate live key
//                                dispatches state "rejected". No timer
//                                polling anywhere: the source wakes the
//                                loop itself.
//   Cmd.channelClose(key)        close the open channel under the key, if
//                                any: staged posts flush, exactly one
//                                "closed" event (final drop totals)
//                                dispatches the event arm, and the key
//                                frees. A key with no open channel no-ops.
//
// The window verbs (fire-and-forget, no result Msg — the window's own
// frame event carries the state):
//
//   Cmd.showWindow(label)        un-hide + activate the window with the
//                                declared label — the counterpart to a
//                                `close_policy = "hide"` hide and the tray
//                                "Open" consequence; also restores a
//                                minimized window. An unknown label is a
//                                no-op.
//   Cmd.quitApp()                graceful terminate, the tray "Quit"
//                                consequence: the host quits through the
//                                SAME shutdown path a last-window close
//                                takes, so the stop hook runs exactly once
//                                and a recording session seals its journal.
//
// The keyed-effect discipline is ONE rule: a keyed effect REPLACES its live
// predecessor (the superseded effect's result is dropped — no message), and
// Cmd.cancel drops it silently. That holds for request, readFile, writeFile,
// fetch, clipboardRead, and delay alike. The ONE exception is a live spawn
// key: a duplicate REJECTS the new spawn (err arm "rejected") — a running
// subprocess is never killed implicitly; cancel it first. And spawn's cancel
// stays loud (err arm "cancelled"): killing a process is an observable event.
//
// `Sub` is the recurring-effects surface: an app may export
// `subscriptions(model): Sub<Msg>` returning declarative descriptors the
// host reconciles after every commit (Sub.timer fires the named arm with the
// current time on each interval). Like Cmd, Sub values are inert data, legal
// only in that function's return path (NS1025). Sub and the streaming Cmds
// are different animals on purpose: a Sub is DECLARED from the model (the
// host starts/stops it by reconciliation; the app never opens one), while
// spawn/audioPlay streams are Cmd-INITIATED — imperative opens with a keyed
// lifecycle the app drives and cancels.
//
// The factories return plain frozen-shape objects so the same core runs
