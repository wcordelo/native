// `Cmd` is the typed-effects surface (spec section 2): `update` (and, since
// v2, `initialModel`) may return `[model, cmd]`, where the cmd is INERT DATA
// describing effects for the runtime to perform after the returned model
// commits. Commands are built only from these factories, and only in that
// return path (NS1017) — they never live in the Model, in a Msg, in a local,
// or in a helper.
//
// The v3 command set:
//
//   Cmd.none                     no effects (what a bare `return model` means)
//   Cmd.persist()                ask the host to persist the committed model
//   Cmd.now("tick")              request a timestamp; the runtime dispatches
//                                the named Msg arm with the time (ms) as its
//                                single number payload field
//   Cmd.host(name, ...args)      a host command by name with scalar args —
//                                the host interprets the name
//   Cmd.host(name, payload)      the same, carrying one bytes payload — a
//                                Uint8Array, or a flat record of number /
//                                boolean / Uint8Array fields that lowers to
//                                bytes (hostRecordBytes below)
//   Cmd.request(name, payload,   a routed host command: the host performs it
//               { key?, ok, err })  and dispatches the `ok` Msg arm with the
//                                result bytes, or the `err` arm with the error
//                                bytes — each arm carries exactly one
//                                Uint8Array payload field, checked by tsc. The
//                                optional `key` names the in-flight effect:
//                                re-issuing a live key replaces it, and
//                                Cmd.cancel(key) drops it.
//   Cmd.cancel(key)              drop the in-flight keyed effect — request,
//                                readFile/writeFile/fetch/clipboardRead, or
//                                delay — SILENTLY (no terminal arm dispatch).
//                                Aimed at a live spawn it stays LOUD: the
//                                child dies and the err arm runs with
//                                "cancelled" — killing a process is an
//                                observable event
//   Cmd.batch([a, b, ...])       several commands from one dispatch

//                                as its single number payload; re-issuing a

//                                run a subprocess. Line mode streams each
//                                stdout line to the `line` arm (one Uint8Array
//                                field; omit `line` to drop lines); collect
//                                mode buffers whole stdout instead. Exactly one
//                                terminal follows: a clean exit dispatches
//                                `exit` — line mode: one number field (the exit
//                                code); collect mode: a two-field record, one
//                                number (the code) and one Uint8Array (the
//                                collected stdout), matched by type — and every
//                                other end dispatches `err` with the reason
//                                bytes ("signaled", "cancelled", "rejected",
//                                "spawn_failed", "truncated"). Cmd.cancel(key)
//                                ends the child mid-stream (err arm
//                                "cancelled" — never silent).
//   Cmd.audioPlay(key, { path?, url?, cachePath?, expectedBytes? }, { event })
//                                open (or replace — one player is the whole
//                                surface) the audio event stream: every
//                                playback event dispatches the `event` arm (the
//                                six-field record below) until Cmd.audioStop
//                                closes the stream.
//   Cmd.audioPause(key) / audioResume(key) / audioStop(key)
//   Cmd.audioSeek(key, ms) / Cmd.audioSetVolume(key, volume)
//                                drive the open stream in place — fire-and-
//                                forget control verbs whose consequences arrive
//                                on the event stream; aimed at a key with no
//                                open stream they no-op.
//
// The window verbs (fire-and-forget, no result Msg — the window's own
// frame event carries the state):
//
//   Cmd.showWindow(label)        un-hide + activate the window with the
//                                declared label — the counterpart to a
//                                `close_policy = "hide"` hide and the tray
//                                "Open" consequence; also restores a
//                                minimized window. An unknown label is a
//                                no-op.
//   Cmd.quitApp()                graceful terminate, the tray "Quit"
//                                consequence: the host quits through the
//                                SAME shutdown path a last-window close
//                                takes, so the stop hook runs exactly once
//                                and a recording session seals its journal.
//
// The keyed-effect discipline is ONE rule: a keyed effect REPLACES its live
// predecessor (the superseded effect's result is dropped — no message), and
// Cmd.cancel drops it silently. That holds for request, readFile, writeFile,
// fetch, clipboardRead, and delay alike. The ONE exception is a live spawn
// key: a duplicate REJECTS the new spawn (err arm "rejected") — a running
// subprocess is never killed implicitly; cancel it first. And spawn's cancel
// stays loud (err arm "cancelled"): killing a process is an observable event.
//
// `Sub` is the recurring-effects surface: an app may export
// `subscriptions(model): Sub<Msg>` returning declarative descriptors the
// host reconciles after every commit (Sub.timer fires the named arm with the
// current time on each interval). Like Cmd, Sub values are inert data, legal
// only in that function's return path (NS1025). Sub and the streaming Cmds
// are different animals on purpose: a Sub is DECLARED from the model (the
// host starts/stops it by reconciliation; the app never opens one), while
// spawn/audioPlay streams are Cmd-INITIATED — imperative opens with a keyed
// lifecycle the app drives and cancels.
//

// under node: a dev harness can interpret the `op` tags directly.
