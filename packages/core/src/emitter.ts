// The Zig emitter: mapping rules R1-R18 from the subset spec, applied
// mechanically to the checked, integer-inferred module.
//
// Output contract: HUMAN-READABLE Zig — your names are your names. Fields,
// declarations, and variables all keep their TS spellings (markup binds the
// model's field names exactly as written), source comments ride along, and
// every construct maps by rule, never by per-site judgment. The eject story
// depends on a person being able to adopt this file and on the markup still
// binding the same names afterwards.
//
// Anything outside the implemented mapping stops the build with NS9001 — the
// emitter re-derives the subset rules and refuses to guess (spec section 5,
// enforcement layer 3).
