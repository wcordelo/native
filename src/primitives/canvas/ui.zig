//! Experimental declarative authoring layer over the retained widget tree.
//!
//! `Ui(Msg)` builds widget trees without hand-assigned object ids, absolute
//! frames, or string command dispatch:
//!
//! - Identity is structural: each widget id is derived from its parent id,
//!   kind, and key (explicit in `each`, sibling index otherwise), so ids stay
//!   stable across rebuilds and keyed reorders without author bookkeeping.
//!   Structural identity is parent-scoped: a keyed item that moves to a
//!   different parent gets a new id. Items that migrate between containers
//!   (board columns, tab pages) should set `global_key`, which pins identity
//!   to (kind, key) independent of position in the tree.
//! - Event handlers are typed `Msg` values collected into a handler table,
//!   so dispatch is compiler-checked instead of string-matched.
//! - Flex layout fields are the authoring default; `frame` is the escape
//!   hatch for absolutely positioned regions.
//!
//! Build failures (arena exhaustion) latch on the builder and surface as an
//! error from `finalize`, keeping view code free of per-node `try`.
