//! Batched text-measurement advances: one provider call per text RUN.
//!
//! Line breaking used to measure the growing line prefix once per UTF-8
//! cluster through `TextMeasureProvider.measureWidth` — O(L²) bytes
//! measured per line, one host round-trip per cluster on platforms whose
//! provider crosses an FFI boundary. This module turns that into ONE
//! batched provider call per run: the host returns per-cluster advances
//! for the whole run, and every consumer breaks lines (or sums slice
//! widths) from cumulative advances exactly the way the deterministic
//! estimator path always has.
//!
//! Advance layout contract (shared with `PlatformServices.
//! measure_text_advances_fn` and `TextMeasureProvider.measure_advances_fn`):
//! the output array is per BYTE, `text.len` entries. The advance of the
//! UTF-8 cluster starting at byte `i` is stored at index `i`; the
//! cluster's continuation bytes hold exactly 0. A slice width is
//! therefore the plain sum of its byte range (adding the interleaved
//! zeros is an exact f32 identity), and a cluster walk reads one entry
//! per lead byte — no cluster-index bookkeeping on either side.
//!
//! Caching: fetched runs are retained in a bounded, least-recently-used
//! keyed store so steady-state rebuilds of unchanged text skip the
//! provider entirely. Keys cover the text BYTES (content hash, not
//! pointer identity — retained text storage rewrites bytes in place),
//! the font id, the size, the provider identity (context + function),
//! and the global measure generation below. Runs longer than a cache
//! slot use a single uncached scratch slot (still one batched call per
//! fetch); runs longer than the scratch fall back to the caller's
//! unbatched path.
//!
//! Generation: `bumpTextMeasureGeneration` invalidates every cached
//! advance (and the retained wrap results keyed on the same generation
//! in text_spans.zig). The runtime bumps it when a font registers (the
//! host just learned a new face for an id), when the platform appearance
//! flips (theme-derived typography may re-resolve host fonts), and when
//! a runtime constructs (so a recycled provider context pointer from a
//! previous runtime in the same process can never serve stale advances).
//!
//! Thread model: storage is threadlocal, matching the runtime's
//! single-threaded frame path and the other threadlocal planner scratch
//! in this codebase (`text_layout_cache.zig`'s probe tables, the canvas
//! packet baseline scratch). Two runtimes on two threads simply keep
//! independent caches. The generation counter is a process-wide atomic
//! so an invalidation on the runtime loop thread is seen everywhere.
//!
//! Lifetime rule for returned slices: a returned advances slice aliases
//! cache (or scratch) storage and is only valid until the NEXT
//! `textRunAdvances` call on the same thread — consume it immediately;
//! never hold it across another fetch.
