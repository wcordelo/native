//! Dev-session process ownership. `native dev` runs an app (and possibly
//! a frontend dev server) under child processes that spawn children of
//! their own — `zig build run` owns the app binary, a dev-server command
//! spawns the real server. Killing only the direct child leaves those
//! grandchildren running, and an orphaned automation-enabled app keeps
//! publishing snapshots into the project's dropbox where it impersonates
//! the next build.
//!
//! The fix: each owned child spawns into its own POSIX process group
//! (`SpawnOptions.pgid = 0`), and the whole group is signalled when the
//! session ends — on the normal exit path AND on SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP
//! delivered to the CLI itself. Windows has no process groups here; the
//! helpers become no-ops and only direct children are killed.
