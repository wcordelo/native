//! Context menus: right/ctrl-click (and a touch long-press, which hosts
//! report the same way) on a canvas widget asks the platform to present
//! the OS context menu at the pointer, and dispatches the selection back
//! through typed messages. The OS menu is the DEFAULT presentation; when
//! this host has no native presenter (or presenting failed), an
//! app-declared menu presents as an anchored canvas surface instead —
//! the app loop answers `canvas_widget_context_menu_request` by mounting
//! the SAME declared items, so authors write one menu and the platform
//! decides presentation.
//!
//! Resolution order for a secondary-button press:
//! 1. the deepest widget on the hit route declaring
//!    `ElementOptions.context_menu` (app-declared, Msg-mapped items),
//! 2. an editable text target: the standard Cut / Copy / Paste /
//!    Select All menu wired to the existing clipboard actions,
//! 3. the view's live static-text selection: a Copy-only menu.
//! The zero-code defaults (2 and 3) are presenter-only: without a native
//! menu they degrade to the keyboard clipboard paths, never a synthesized
//! surface (there are no app-declared items to mount).
//!
//! Presentation is asynchronous (macOS `popUpMenuPositioningItem` runs a
//! nested tracking loop): the platform emits a `context_menu_action`
//! event later, matched here against the pending request.
