//! The native host consumer for transpiled app cores: bridges the
//! versioned command/subscription wire format a transpiled core emits
//! (`packages/core/rt/rt.zig`, `cmd_format_version` 3) onto the
//! real effect engine (`effects.zig`). The transpiler's output is a
//! pure Model/Msg/update core whose effects are INERT BYTES — this
//! module is the one place those bytes become engine calls, so the
//! entire existing effects machinery (executors, keyed slots, the
//! completion queue, the session journal, replay) carries transpiled
//! cores without a parallel engine.
//!
//! `TsCoreHost(core)` is comptime-generic over the emitted core module
//! and expects the emitted ABI:
//!
//!   core.rt              the core's rt kernel: `frameAlloc`,
//!                        `frameReset`, `resetAll`
//!   core.Model           the committed model struct
//!   core.Msg             the app Msg `union(enum)` (wire tags are the
//!                        arms' declaration-order indices)
//!   core.initialModel()  `*const Model`, or `InitResult{ model, cmd }`
//!                        for a boot command
//!   core.update(m, msg)  `*const Model`, or `UpdateResult{ model, cmd }`
//!   core.commitModelRoot the frame-end commit walker
//!   core.subscriptions   optional: `fn (*const Model) []const u8`
//!
//! Like the rt kernel it drives, a host instance is container-level
//! state — the v1 contract is ONE LIVE APP PER CORE MODULE: two apps
//! over the same emitted core in one process would share a committed
//! root and one set of bridge tables. Two DIFFERENT core modules
//! coexist fine (each staged core carries its own rt.zig module
//! instance, so kernels never alias; distinct core types get distinct
//! hosts) — the e2e suite drives two live cores side by side to pin
//! exactly that.
//!
//! THE DISPATCH CYCLE — every Msg runs update → commit → command walk →
//! subscription reconcile → frame reset, in that order, because the
//! command and subscription bytes are frame-arena resident and must be
//! consumed before the reset. Wire records map onto the engine as:
//!
//!   persist     -> `fx.hostSend("core.persist", "")` — the host-
//!                  snapshot verb is a named host service like any
//!                  other; hosts that implement persistence bind it.
//!   now         -> `fx.wallMs()` (the journaled clock read) captured
//!                  during the walk; the named arm dispatches with that
//!                  time SYNCHRONOUSLY — immediately after the issuing
//!                  cycle completes, depth-first, before control
//!                  returns to the drain. This mirrors `fx.wallMs`'s
//!                  same-dispatch semantics for Zig cores and replays
//!                  deterministically through the `.clock` journal.
//!   host        -> `fx.hostSend(name, args)` — fire-and-forget; the
//!                  payload is the record's own arg block (`argc` f64
//!                  little-endian values, no count byte), decoded by
//!                  the named service per its build-time contract.
//!   host_bytes  -> `fx.hostSend(name, payload)` — fire-and-forget.
//!   request     -> `fx.hostRequest` with a bridge-assigned engine key
//!                  (`request_key_base` + table index, deterministic in
//!                  issue order). Completion routes the ok/err arm with
//!                  the result bytes; re-issuing a live wire key
//!                  replaces the pending request (the engine drops the
//!                  old result silently) and `cancel` drops it.
//!   read_file   -> `fx.readFile`; the terminal routes the ok arm with
//!                  the content bytes, or the err arm with the outcome
//!                  name as bytes ("not_found", "io_failed",
//!                  "truncated", "rejected").
//!   write_file  -> `fx.writeFile`; the ok arm carries no payload (a
//!                  void Msg arm), the err arm the outcome name.
//!   fetch       -> `fx.fetch` (buffered); an `.ok` un-truncated
//!                  response routes the ok arm as a two-field record —
//!                  the number field gets the real HTTP status (non-2xx
//!                  included), the bytes field the whole body, matched
//!                  by FIELD TYPE, so arm field names are the app's.
//!                  Every other outcome routes the err arm with the
//!                  outcome name; a truncated body routes err
//!                  ("truncated") rather than passing a silently cut
//!                  body as ok. Wire timeout 0 means the engine
//!                  default.
//!   clip_write  -> `fx.writeClipboard` fire-and-forget (`on_result`
//!                  null): a refused or over-bound write is dropped by
//!                  design — there is no route to report on. Engine
//!                  keys rotate through `clip_write_key_base` +
//!                  issue counter so back-to-back writes never collide.
//!   clip_read   -> `fx.readClipboard`; ok arm gets the text bytes,
//!                  err arm the outcome name ("failed", "rejected").
//!   delay       -> `fx.startTimer` (`.one_shot`) in its own slot table
//!                  (`delay_key_base` + index). Fires once, dispatching
//!                  the named arm with the fire time in fractional ms;
//!                  re-issuing a live delay key re-arms the same slot
//!                  from now (the debounce discipline) and `cancel`
//!                  drops it silently (a cancelled delay just never
//!                  fires).
//!   spawn       -> `fx.spawn` through the STREAM table (`spawn_key_base`
//!                  + index) — the one NON-RETIRING entry kind: unlike a
//!                  named op, whose entry retires on its first (only)
//!                  terminal, a stream entry stays live across
//!                  dispatches while `.lines`-mode stdout lines route
//!                  the line arm (line tag 0xFF = no line routing), and
//!                  retires only when the ONE exit terminal delivers —
//!                  a clean `.exited` end routes the exit arm (line
//!                  mode: the code as its single number payload;
//!                  collect mode: a code/output two-field record
//!                  matched by field TYPE, exactly the fetch record
//!                  mechanism), every other end (`signaled`,
//!                  `cancelled`, `rejected`, `spawn_failed`, and a
//!                  collect stdout over the engine bound, reason
//!                  "truncated") routes the err arm with the reason
//!                  bytes. Line/drop truncation flags are not surfaced
//!                  in v1: an over-bound line arrives cut to the
//!                  engine's 4 KiB line bound.
//!   audio_play  -> `fx.playAudio` on the bridge's single audio entry;
//!                  a URL record carrying no cache path plays under the
//!                  engine's conventional content-addressed cache path
//!                  when the wiring configured a caches directory
//!                  (`setAudioCacheDir` / `TsUiApp`'s `audio_cache_dir`)
//!                  — derived bridge-side from the URL alone, so update
//!                  stays pure and replay re-derives identically. The
//!                  entry itself is `audio_key_base` (the engine has
//!                  ONE player, so the bridge holds one stream),
//!                  non-retiring the spawn way, keyed by the wire key:
//!                  every `EffectAudio` event (loaded/position/
//!                  completed/failed/rejected/spectrum) routes the
//!                  event arm — a six-field record built by field NAME
//!                  (state/positionMs/durationMs/playing/buffering/
//!                  bands; `state`'s enum members are matched by member
//!                  name, so the app's declaration order is free) —
//!                  until audio_ctl `stop` (or a replacing audio_play,
//!                  which re-keys and re-routes the same entry) closes
//!                  it. `completed`/`failed`/`rejected` do NOT retire
//!                  the entry: the platform may still speak (soundboard
//!                  starts the next track from `completed`), and stop
//!                  is the explicit close.
//!   audio_ctl   -> the engine's control verbs (`fx.pauseAudio`/
//!                  `resumeAudio`/`stopAudio`/`seekAudio`/
//!                  `setAudioVolume`), gated by the wire key: a verb
//!                  whose key does not name the open stream is a no-op
//!                  (the playback it aimed at is gone). `stop` also
//!                  retires the bridge entry — no events for that key
//!                  after it.
//!   window_show -> `fx.showWindow(label)` — fire-and-forget, label-
//!                  addressed like the Zig tier's verb: un-hide +
//!                  activate (the tray "Open" consequence of the
//!                  menu-bar-app loop). No result Msg; the window's own
//!                  frame event carries the state.
//!   quit_app    -> `fx.quitApp()` — the graceful terminate through the
//!                  same shutdown path a last-window close takes.
//!   cancel      -> by wire key, first match wins in this order: the
//!                  request table (`fx.cancelHostRequest`, silent), the
//!                  named-op table (the entry is marked dropped and
//!                  `fx.cancel` issued — the engine's `.cancelled`
//!                  terminal retires the entry and the bridge swallows
//!                  it: SILENT, no arm dispatches), the stream table
//!                  (`fx.cancel` — the child dies and its exit routes
//!                  the err arm with "cancelled"; killing a process IS
//!                  an observable event, so spawn's cancel stays loud),
//!                  the delay table (`fx.cancelTimer`, silent). The
//!                  audio stream is not cancel's to end — audio_ctl
//!                  `stop` is its close.
//!
//! THE KEYED-EFFECT DISCIPLINE is ONE rule across request, read_file,
//! write_file, fetch, clip_read, and delay: a keyed effect REPLACES its
//! live predecessor (the superseded effect's result is dropped — no
//! message), and `cancel` drops it silently (no terminal arm dispatch).
//! For the named ops the bridge implements the drop by marking the
//! superseded entry dropped and cancelling its engine call; the
//! engine's `.cancelled` terminal retires the entry and its Msg is
//! swallowed before dispatch. The ONE exception is a live `Cmd.spawn`
//! key: a duplicate REJECTS the new spawn — its err arm dispatches with
//! "rejected" right after the issuing cycle (the same post-cycle
//! boundary `now` dispatches use) — because a running subprocess is
//! never killed implicitly; cancel it first. And spawn's explicit
//! cancel stays loud (err arm "cancelled"), because killing a process
//! is an observable event.
//!   Sub timer   -> `fx.startTimer` (repeating) with a fixed slot table
//!                  reconciled by wire key: a new key arms the first
//!                  free slot (slot order — deterministic, never hash
//!                  order), a changed interval re-arms the same slot, a
//!                  tag-only change re-routes without re-arming, and a
//!                  key absent from the set cancels. Each fire
//!                  dispatches the named arm with the fire time in
//!                  fractional milliseconds.
//!
//! THE RESULT-ORDERING CONTRACT: routed results and timer fires are
//! ordinary engine completions — they queue in completion order and
//! dispatch when the host drains (`Effects.takeMsg`, i.e. UiApp's
//! `.effects_wake` and presented-frame drains), exactly like Zig-core
//! fx results. The bridge adds no scheduler of its own; the one
//! deliberate exception is `now` (above), which is synchronous the way
//! `fx.wallMs` is.
//!
//! Result payload lifetime: the engine's result bytes are drain
//! scratch, but a routed result's bytes become a Msg payload the core
//! may store in the model — so the Msg constructors copy them into the
//! core's frame arena first, where the commit walkers classify them as
//! frame-resident and copy whatever the model keeps into the heap.
//!
//! Malformed wire bytes are teaching panics, not error codes: the only
//! producer is the transpiler's own rt builders, so a bad record is a
//! build-pipeline bug the app author must see immediately.
