//! Session replay: drive a recorded journal back through the dispatch
//! choke point, deterministically, and verify equivalence.
//!
//! The journal is the world: the app's effects channel is armed into
//! replay mode FIRST (fake executor — `fx.spawn`/`fx.fetch`/file/
//! clipboard requests park in their slots; no process, network, file, or
//! pasteboard is ever touched), then records replay in file order —
//! effect results feed the parked requests, events dispatch through
//! `Runtime.dispatchPlatformEvent` exactly as the platform once did, and
//! checkpoints compare the live state fingerprint (and screenshot pixel
//! hashes) against what the recording saw.
//!
//! Replay hosts on the null platform: window creates, presents, and
//! timers are inert there, and every input that matters arrives from the
//! journal (timer fires and effect wakes are platform events, so they
//! ride the event stream like everything else).
//!
//! THE INIT CONTRACT (see session_journal.zig): replay re-runs the app's
//! own model init and `init_fx` rather than restoring a serialized
//! model, so both must be deterministic. A violation shows up here as
//! the first mismatching checkpoint.
//!
//! Divergence is loud and specific: a fed effect result whose key has no
//! parked request (`ReplayEffectDivergence`) means update spawned
//! different effects than the recording — usually nondeterminism outside
//! the effect boundary; a fingerprint mismatch names the event ordinal
//! and frame where state first differed.
