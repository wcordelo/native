//! Runtime-owned application loop for the declarative ui builder.
//!
//! `UiApp(Model, Msg)` wraps an elm-style app — model value, `update`
//! function, `view` function — as a `native_sdk.App`, owning everything the
//! builder examples previously hand-rolled: the two-arena rebuild swap, the
//! first-frame install choreography (`setCanvasWidgetLayout` +
//! `emitCanvasWidgetDisplayList`), presentation buffers, resize handling,
//! and typed pointer/keyboard dispatch through the tree's handler table.
//!
//! An app becomes: declare `Model` and `Msg`, write `update` and `view`,
//! and hand them to `UiApp` with a shell scene containing one `gpu_surface`
//! view. Shell command events can map into messages through `on_command`.
//!
//! Secondary windows are model-declared: `Options.windows_fn` returns the
//! window descriptors that should exist right now (presence IS
//! visibility), `Options.window_view` builds each declared window's
//! canvas tree, the runtime reconciles declared against live windows
//! after every rebuild, input from any window dispatches Msgs with its
//! window identity, and a user close dispatches the descriptor's
//! `on_close` Msg — the dismissal precedent, applied to windows.
//!
//! Markup apps choose an engine per build: `Options.markup` runs the
//! runtime parser/interpreter (dev, hot reload), while
//! `canvas.CompiledMarkupView(Model, Msg, source).build` handed to
//! `Options.view` compiles the same source at comptime (release, no parser
//! in the binary — pair with `UiAppWithFeatures(..., .{ .runtime_markup =
//! false })` so the watch machinery compiles out too). Setting both keeps
//! the compiled view until the watched file first changes on disk.
