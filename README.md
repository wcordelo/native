# zero-native

Build native desktop apps with Zig, secure WebView surfaces, native controls, and OS capabilities. Tiny binaries. Minimal memory. Instant rebuilds.

zero-native is a native app framework where WebView content is one first-class surface, not the whole app model. Use native windows, menus, shortcuts, controls, dialogs, and OS services around rich web product UI. Use the platform WebView when you want the smallest possible app, or bundle Chromium through CEF when rendering consistency matters.

## Quick Start

Install the CLI:

```bash
npm install -g zero-native
```

Create and run an app:

```bash
zero-native init my_app --frontend next
cd my_app
zig build run
```

The first run installs frontend dependencies, builds the generated native shell, and opens a desktop window rendering your WebView content.

## Why zero-native

### Native shell, web where it fits

Build app chrome and trusted utility surfaces with native views, while keeping WebViews available for rich product UI, frontend framework workflows, and rendering consistency when you need it.

### Tiny and fast

System WebView apps do not bundle a browser runtime, so the native shell stays small and starts quickly. Your app uses WKWebView on macOS and WebKitGTK on Linux.

### Choose your web engine

Pick the engine that fits the product. System WebView gives you a lightweight native footprint. Chromium through CEF gives you predictable rendering and a pinned web platform on supported targets.

### Fast native rebuilds

The native layer is Zig, so app logic, bridge commands, and platform integrations rebuild quickly. Your frontend can still use the web tooling you already know.

### OS power without heavy glue

Zig calls C directly, which keeps platform SDKs, native libraries, codecs, and local system integrations within reach when the WebView layer needs to do real native work.

### Explicit security model

The WebView is treated as untrusted by default. Native commands, permissions, navigation, external links, and window APIs are opt-in and policy controlled.

## Status

zero-native is pre-release. Desktop support now covers macOS 11+, Linux, and Windows build paths, native controls on system-WebView hosts, and Chromium/CEF distributed as platform-specific runtimes.

## Core Concepts

`App` is the small Zig object that describes your application: name, WebView source, lifecycle hooks, an optional native scene, and native services.

`Runtime` owns the event loop, windows, native views, WebViews, command routing, bridge dispatch, automation hooks, tracing, and platform services.

`ShellConfig` declares native-first windows and view trees: toolbars, sidebars, status bars, split panes, stacks, controls, WebViews, and future surface kinds.

`WebViewSource` tells the runtime what a WebView should load: inline HTML, a URL, or packaged frontend assets served from a local app origin.

`app.zon` is the app manifest. It declares app metadata, icons, windows, native shell views, frontend assets, web engine selection, security policy, bridge permissions, and packaging inputs.

`window.zero.*` is the guarded JavaScript-to-native bridge for commands, windows, views, WebViews, dialogs, clipboard, credentials, and OS services. Calls are size-limited, origin checked, permission checked, and routed only to allowed handlers.

## Configuration

Most project-level behavior lives in `app.zon`:

```zig
.{
    .id = "com.example.my-app",
    .name = "my-app",
    .display_name = "My App",
    .version = "0.1.0",
    .web_engine = "system",
    .permissions = .{},
    .capabilities = .{ "webview" },
    .security = .{
        .navigation = .{
            .allowed_origins = .{ "zero://app", "http://127.0.0.1:5173" },
        },
    },
    .windows = .{
        .{ .label = "main", .title = "My App", .width = 960, .height = 640 },
    },
}
```

Use `.web_engine = "system"` for the platform WebView. On supported macOS builds, use `.web_engine = "chromium"` with a `.cef` config when you want to bundle Chromium.

## Examples

Framework-specific starter examples live in `examples/`:

- `examples/next`
- `examples/react`
- `examples/svelte`
- `examples/vue`

Each example is a complete zero-native app with `app.zon`, a Zig shell, and a minimal frontend project. Run one with `zig build run` from its directory.

Native-first examples are available too:

- `examples/command-app` - shared command routing across native controls, menus, shortcuts, tray, and bridge calls
- `examples/native-shell` - native toolbar/sidebar/statusbar chrome around WebView content
- `examples/native-panels` - split/stack native panel composition with WebView content
- `examples/capabilities` - guarded OS services such as notifications, clipboard, dialogs, credentials, file drops, and recent documents
- `examples/mobile-shell` - shared metadata for the iOS and Android native shell hosts

Mobile embedding examples are available too:

- `examples/ios`
- `examples/android`

These show how an iOS or Android host app links the zero-native C ABI from `libzero-native.a`.
