//! soundboard theme: the Geist pack with the accent moved to the pack's
//! pink scale. The pack resolves the whole register (palette, control
//! tables, type scale, metrics) per scheme and contrast; the app layers
//! ONE brand decision on top through `DesignTokenOverrides` — it never
//! forks the pack. High-contrast requests skip the override and take the
//! pack's high-contrast register untouched (accessibility beats brand),
//! and reduce-motion zeroes the motion tokens through the theme options.

///   segment, "Playing" badges, the loaded row's title ink, and every
///   control fill that derives from the accent channel (checkbox,
///   switch, progress).
/// - `colors.focus_ring`: the pack spends its identity hue on focus;
///   with the identity moved to pink, the ring follows so focus and
///   accent chrome read as one system (pink on the page clears the 3:1
///   non-text bar in both schemes).
/// - `controls.slider.active_background`: the pack's slider table states
///   its own hue for the filled range rather than deriving from the
///   accent channel, so the seek scrubber needs the same move stated
///   once more or it would keep the pack's stock hue.
