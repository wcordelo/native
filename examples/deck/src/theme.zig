//! deck theme: the whole skin, expressed as design tokens — no widget
//! code knows it is dressed as hardware.
//!
//! THIS SKIN IS CUSTOM BY DESIGN. It deliberately does not follow the
//! framework's theme packs or the OS color scheme: the deck is a piece
//! of vintage rack hardware, and hardware has exactly one finish — warm
//! cream/putty enamel chassis panels around dark smoked-glass display
//! bays that print in phosphor green. Every value below is this
//! product's identity, not a restatement of the house register; apps
//! that want the house look should start from `DesignTokens.theme` and
//! stop there.
//!
//! The palette is split across two physical materials, and the token
//! table allocates its slots by MATERIAL rather than by the house
//! semantics:
//!   - enamel (the chassis): `surface` is the enamel, `text` is the
//!     silkscreened ink, `text_muted` the lighter engraving gray,
//!     `border` the putty hairline between plates.
//!   - glass (the display bays): `background` is the smoked glass —
//!     every bay fills with it — `accent` is the LIVE phosphor,
//!     `success` the pale phosphor a readout prints in at rest, and
//!     `info` the dim phosphor of engraved-on-glass captions (this app
//!     has no informational-violet surface, so the slot is spent on the
//!     third phosphor register; a teaching trade, stated here).
//! Signal amber (`warning`) is reserved for the failure stamps (NO
//! MEDIA, STREAM LOST, and their remedy lines) — the one non-green hue
//! on the glass.
//!
//! Accessibility still beats brand: a high-contrast request abandons the
//! skin for the framework's high-contrast light palette and stock
//! control chrome, and reduce-motion zeroes the motion tokens.
