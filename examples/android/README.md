# Android Example

A minimal Android mobile shell that embeds a Native SDK static library through JNI. The example keeps a native Android header above a WebView workspace and routes native navigation/header actions through the Native SDK command path.

Android views own the mobile shell layout: native header sizing, density-aware resize events, touch forwarding, and the `WebView` workspace. The Native SDK runtime is driven through JNI calls into the C ABI.

## Build the native library

Build or package an Android static library from the repository root, then copy it into this example:

```bash
zig build lib -Dtarget=aarch64-linux-android
mkdir -p examples/android/app/src/main/cpp/lib
cp zig-out/lib/libnative-sdk.a examples/android/app/src/main/cpp/lib/libnative-sdk.a
```

The CMake project expects the library at `app/src/main/cpp/lib/libnative-sdk.a` and the C header at `app/src/main/cpp/native_sdk.h`.

## Run

Open `examples/android` in Android Studio, or build from the command line with a configured Android SDK:

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

Install on an emulator or device:

```bash
./gradlew :app:installDebug
```

## Files

- `app/src/main/java/dev/native_sdk/examples/android/MainActivity.kt` hosts native Android chrome, a WebView workspace, a `SurfaceView`, and the JNI bridge.
- `app/src/main/cpp/native_sdk_jni.c` forwards JNI calls to the Native SDK C ABI.
- `app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt` imports `libnative-sdk.a` and builds the JNI shared library.
- `app.zon` records the mobile example metadata for Native SDK tooling.

## Host lifecycle

- `onCreate` loads the JNI library, creates the native shell, then starts the Native SDK app.
- `onResume` and `onPause` forward activation lifecycle with `native_sdk_app_activate` and `native_sdk_app_deactivate`.
- `surfaceChanged` forwards size, display density, safe-area insets, keyboard inset, and the Android `Surface`, then requests a frame.
- Orientation and screen-size changes stay in the same activity so the embedded runtime is not recreated during rotation.
- The activity uses `windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"` so Android owns keyboard avoidance and relayouts the content area.
- The native Back and Refresh buttons call `nativeCommand` with stable mobile command IDs, update status from `native_sdk_app_last_command_count`, and request a frame.
- The Android system Back action dispatches `mobile.back` through the same command path.
- `onTouchEvent` forwards pointer id, phase, position, and pressure.
- The JNI bridge exposes hardware key, committed text, and IME composition entry points for GPU/widget text fields.
- The embedded C ABI can expose retained GPU/widget accessibility semantics by indexed snapshot and dispatch widget accessibility actions for Android accessibility providers.
- `surfaceDestroyed` and `onDestroy` stop and destroy the app.

The `app.zon` shell view tree describes this header and WebView workspace. Native mobile layout is still implemented in Kotlin so Android owns soft-keyboard relayout, Back handling, orientation changes, and activity lifecycle while the Native SDK receives the viewport metrics needed for GPU/widget layout.
